#WIKI getter

It was a proof of concept website that could simulate mind-maps using the wikipedias API.

The principle behind the website is to write a topic you want to find related topics on and it will create a mind map for you.

It works by using the WIKIPEDIA API to find hyperlinks to related topics and thus creating topic to topic relationships.

Sadly, this project hasn't been updated for a number of years and during the time other people got the same idea and created better website with the same promise, but looking at my repositories initialization date, I believe I was the first.
